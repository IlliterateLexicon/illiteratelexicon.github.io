			<h2>void Neoterm() { <i>#BETA (<a href='https://github.com/illiterateLexicon/neoterm.git'>github</a>)</i></h2>
      <p>Neoterm provids a simple way to interact with a posix terminal and do things like set color, get and set
      cursor position, get and set termios attributes, get input, and more. It was originally meant to be an
      expanded and more complex version of <a href=https://pypi.org/project/py-term/>py-term</a>. neoterm is currently
      writtien in c++, to allow it to be binded to python, lua and many others. However the original version was coded
      in python3, then later coded in lua before decieding to move to c++.</p>

			<h2>void Hexes() { <i>#ALPHA (<a href=https://github.com/illiterateLexicon/hexes.git>github</a>)</i></h2>
      <p> Hexes is a libaray for higher level interaction similar to curses with the goal of allowing you to create
      rather complex TUIs very easily as you might have guessed from the name Hexes is loosely based off of
      <a href=https://github.com/mirror/ncurses>curses/ncurses</a>. As I metioned hexes and neoterm and sister librarys
      meaning that while neoterm can be used seprately its inital purpose was to split parts of hexes that might want
      to be used in seprate projects. was my attempt to somewhat follow the unix philosphy of writeing small
      bits that all interact instead of a monothic blob that is only good for one thing. </p>

			<h2>void GameEngine() { <i>#NULL</i></h2>
			<p> A dream of mine is to create my own game engine and use it to create games with (most likely coded in c++ using openGL with lua &| python scripting)</p>
